I'm a former web-designer (formed by [Gobelins Paris](https://www.gobelins-school.com/)) with a nearly 15 years experience into graphic design.  
I was always interested into the development side so it is quite normal for me to finally learning how to code at [Coding Academy Paris](https://www.coding-academy.fr/).  

This website is one of the many tasks we have to do for us to practice and learn how to code.  
It is a short (4 months) but intense learning process [Coding-Academy - Web&Go](https://www.coding-academy.fr/web-go/).  

I won't call me "front end developer" at the end but I would be thrilled to find an internship to help me practice and master some of it.
